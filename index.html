                    <dd>Shoot at a piece, or pieces, along a piece's path of movement. If not all pieces are shot down along this path, the piece can only move to a square before the first piece it would fail to shoot down.</dd>

                    <dd>Each time a piece's rank is lowered, its series range is reduced by one. Even if its rank rises, its series range does not change.</dd>

                    <dt>Rank</dt>
                    <dd>The damage a piece can deal when shooting. This can be increased by unloading an adjacent piece, swapped by bridging two pieces, or decreased when shot by a piece of a lower rank.</dd>

                    <dd>A piece receives enough damage to lower its rank to zero or less, thereby removing the piece from play.</dd>

                    <dd>A piece joins to an adjacent piece, forcing the two to either move in tandem in one direction or to orbit one another. Movement depends on the lower-ranked bridged piece's orientation, unless orbiting. Orbiting uses a bridged piece's bridge range for its movement. Shots depend on the higher-ranked bridge piece's rank and range. However, whichever piece of the two is shooting, as they cannot shoot together, use their shot orientation.</dd>
                    <dd>When shot by another piece, the rank of the bridged piece being shot is reduced accordingly. If shot down, half of the shot down bridged piece's rank, rounded down, is taken from the rank of the remaining piece.'</dd>

                    <dt>Capture</dt>
                    <dd>Remove an enemy piece from play without eliminating it by bridging with it. Player can move the enemy piece following bridging rules, but cannot use the enemy piece to shoot. Enemy cannot unbridge a captured piece.</dd>
                    <dd>A piece that bridges with an enemy of higher rank will become captured by the enemy.</dd>

                    <dt>Unbridge</dt>

                    <dd>Per turn, a player can only move once and shoot once. Shooting in series is considered shooting once.</dd>

                        <li>Shoot in series: Shoot at pieces along path of movement.</li>
                        <li>Replacement: Shoot, then move to shot down piece's position. Can move only as far as piece can move towards shot down piece's position.</li>

                    <dd>A piece can shoot or move against any other piece. It can also unload or bridge to any adjacent piece.</dd>

                    <dt>Right of Way</dt>
                    <dd>No piece can defy its ranges, orientations, or rank, unless bridged. Even while bridged, pieces must follow ranges, orientations and rank as specified.</dd>
                    <dd>Pieces cannot "fly around" or "skip over" other pieces unless their movement allows it, such as the Knight's L-shape movement, the Bishop's diagonal movement used twice, or a bridged piece is orbiting its bridge.</dd>
