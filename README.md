# Shooters Chess

Chess with fighter airships

## Description

With a number of modifications, Shooters Chess features movement, ammunition and rank. While movement remains the same, shooters do not shoot in the same direction as they move, and rank determines if a shooter is shot down or not. While shooters can be moved in the same turn as attacking another shooter, the move must be declared and followed through.

On a player's turn, they can only shoot and/or move with a single shooter, unless a pair of shooters are bridged.

Shooters can shoot down a target that is of the same or a lower rank. If the target is higher in rank than the shooter, the target's rank is reduced by the shooter's rank.

If a target is shot down along the path to a shooter's declared position, the shooter can continue to the declared position. This means in one turn, a shooter can shoot down a series of targets in their path to the declared position. The series are shot in order from nearest to farthest from the shooter. Should a target in the series have a higher rank than the shooter, the shooter can only move up to the position adjacent to the higher ranked target. If the declared position is at the position of the higher ranked target or farther, the movement stops nearer to the shooter's original position.

_Unload_: A shooter can be sacrificed to add its rank to an adjacent shooter. Unless attacking with a king or queen, this will be required to shoot down either.

_Bridge_: Two shooters can join on one side. They either move together in one direction, or one rotates to another position around the other. When shooting a target, the resulting rank is the nearer shooter's plus half the rank of the farther shooter's, rounded down.

**Ranks**: Aside from the king and queen, all other shooters cap at 9, meaning even with unloading, they cannot exceed a rank of 9, whereas the king and queen cap at 10. The lowest rank is 1.

**Victories**
- Checkmate (remaining) queen and king
- Shoot down both queen and king
- Last standing monarch ranked 10

### Pawn
Count: 8
Rank: 1
Movement range: 1
Shooting range: 1

Pawns can move either forward or backward from their original position. They shoot at a diagonal from their position and only then can move to a diagonal position.

Bishops can move diagonally in any direction, but only in one direction per turn. They shoot at right angles from their position, meaning forward, back, left and right.

Rank: 3
Movement range: 3
Shooting range: 1

Knights move in an L-shape, either two at a right angle and then one perpendicular to the movement, or one at a right angle and then two perpendicular to the movement. They shoot on diagonals.

Since they shoot opposite to their movement, they cannot shoot in series.

### Rook
Count: 2
