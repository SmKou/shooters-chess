# Shooters Chess

Chess with additional rules and moves
By: Stella Marie

## Description

Shooters Chess takes traditional chess and turns the pieces into fighter jets that can move and shoot. Aside from adding the shots, Shooters Chess adds un/bridging and unloading. Winning the game also no longer depends on capturing the king, but rather shooting down, capturing and/or placing the other side's monarchs in checkmate.
